## **Approach 1: CLI/Process Communication (Original)**

### **Real-World Scenario**
You need to test Go SDK functionality but want the simplest possible implementation with minimal dependencies.

### **Step-by-Step Implementation**

#### **Step 1: Create Go Command Executor**
The first step involves creating a C# class that can dynamically generate Go code and execute it using the Go runtime. This class will:

1. **Generate Go code dynamically** based on the operation and parameters passed from .NET
2. **Create temporary Go files** in the system's temp directory with the generated code
3. **Execute the Go command** using `Process.Start()` with proper output redirection
4. **Handle errors and cleanup** by capturing stderr, checking exit codes, and removing temporary files

The Go code generation includes importing the conductor-go SDK, setting up environment variables, creating API clients, and executing the requested operations with proper error handling.

#### **Step 2: Create Adapter**
The adapter layer implements the `IEventAdapter` interface and provides a clean abstraction over the CLI execution. This step involves:

1. **Wrapping the CLI client** in an adapter that implements your framework's interface
2. **Parameter mapping** from .NET types to the CLI executor's expected format
3. **Error handling** with proper exception catching and response formatting
4. **Initialization logic** to set up the CLI client with the server URL

#### **Step 3: Integration and Usage**
The final step involves integrating the adapter into your test framework and using it in your test scenarios. This includes:

1. **Initializing the adapter** with the Conductor server URL
2. **Calling adapter methods** to perform operations like adding events
3. **Handling responses** and checking success/failure states
4. **Error handling** at the test level with proper logging and reporting

### **Pros & Cons**
- ‚úÖ **Simple**: Easy to understand and implement
- ‚úÖ **No Dependencies**: Only requires Go installation
- ‚ùå **Slow**: 2-5 seconds per operation
- ‚ùå **Resource Heavy**: High CPU and memory usage
- ‚ùå **Security Risk**: Creates temporary files

## **Approach 2: HTTP API Bridge**

### **Real-World Scenario**
You need better performance than CLI but want to maintain process isolation and standard HTTP communication.

### **Step-by-Step Implementation**

#### **Step 1: Create Go HTTP Server**
The first step involves creating a standalone Go HTTP server that wraps the conductor-go SDK functionality. This server will:

1. **Initialize the conductor-go SDK client** using environment variables for configuration
2. **Set up HTTP routes** using Gorilla Mux for different Conductor operations (add events, get events, etc.)
3. **Implement request handlers** that parse JSON requests, call the appropriate SDK methods, and return JSON responses
4. **Add health check endpoints** for monitoring server status and connection testing
5. **Handle errors gracefully** with proper HTTP status codes and error messages

The server runs on a dedicated port (typically 8081) and provides RESTful endpoints that mirror the conductor-go SDK functionality.

#### **Step 2: Create .NET HTTP Client**
The .NET client manages communication with the Go HTTP server and provides a clean interface for your test framework. This step involves:

1. **HTTP client setup** with proper timeout configuration and connection management
2. **Server lifecycle management** including automatic startup detection and server launching
3. **Request/response handling** with JSON serialization and deserialization
4. **Error handling** for network failures, server errors, and timeout scenarios
5. **Health monitoring** to ensure the Go server is running before making requests

The client automatically starts the Go server if it's not running and manages the connection lifecycle.

#### **Step 3: Create Adapter**
The adapter layer provides the interface between your test framework and the HTTP client. This step involves:

1. **Implementing the IEventAdapter interface** to match your framework's expected contract
2. **Parameter transformation** from .NET types to the HTTP API's expected format
3. **Response processing** to convert HTTP responses back to your framework's response format
4. **Async operation support** for non-blocking HTTP calls
5. **Error handling and logging** with proper exception management and user-friendly error messages

### **Pros & Cons**
- ‚úÖ **Better Performance**: Single server process
- ‚úÖ **Standard Protocol**: HTTP is well-understood
- ‚úÖ **Async Support**: Natural async/await
- ‚ùå **Setup Complexity**: Requires server management
- ‚ùå **Network Overhead**: HTTP communication layer

## **Approach 3: Shared Library/DLL (Current Implementation)**

### **Real-World Scenario**
You need maximum performance with minimal overhead and want direct function calls without process or network communication.

### **Step-by-Step Implementation**

#### **Step 1: Create Go Shared Library**
The first step involves creating a Go shared library that exposes conductor-go SDK functionality through C-compatible function exports. This step includes:

1. **CGO setup** with proper C function declarations and export annotations
2. **Client management** using a global map to store Go API client instances
3. **Function exports** for all major operations (create client, add events, get events, etc.)
4. **Memory management** with proper string allocation and deallocation for C interop
5. **Error handling** with JSON response formatting for error cases

The shared library uses CGO to create a bridge between Go and C, allowing .NET to call Go functions directly through P/Invoke.

#### **Step 2: Build Shared Library**
The build process involves creating a cross-platform build script that compiles the Go code into a shared library. This step includes:

1. **Environment setup** with CGO enabled and proper platform targeting (Windows, Linux, macOS)
2. **Dependency checking** to ensure Go is installed and accessible
3. **Cross-compilation** using Go's build system with CGO support
4. **Output management** with proper file naming and placement in the project structure
5. **Error handling** with clear success/failure messages and exit codes

The build script handles the complexity of CGO compilation and ensures the shared library is properly built for the target platform.

#### **Step 3: Create .NET P/Invoke Client**
The .NET client uses P/Invoke to call the Go shared library functions directly. This step involves:

1. **P/Invoke declarations** with proper DllImport attributes and calling conventions
2. **Memory management** with proper marshaling of strings and pointers
3. **Client lifecycle management** including initialization and cleanup
4. **Method dispatching** to route calls to the appropriate Go functions
5. **Error handling** with proper exception management and resource cleanup

The client provides a clean interface that abstracts away the complexity of P/Invoke calls and memory management.

#### **Step 4: Create Adapter**
The adapter layer provides the interface between your test framework and the shared library client. This step involves:

1. **Interface implementation** to match your framework's expected contract
2. **Response parsing** to convert JSON responses from Go to your framework's format
3. **Error handling** with proper exception catching and response formatting
4. **Type safety** with proper C# classes for request and response objects
5. **Resource management** with proper disposal patterns and cleanup

The adapter ensures that the shared library client integrates seamlessly with your existing test framework architecture.

### **Pros & Cons**

## **Approach 4: gRPC Bridge**

### **Real-World Scenario**
You need high-performance communication with strong typing, streaming capabilities, and want to leverage modern RPC protocols for inter-process communication.

### **Step-by-Step Implementation**

#### **Step 1: Define Protocol Buffers**
The first step involves defining the service contract using Protocol Buffers. This step includes:

1. **Service definition** with all the RPC methods needed for Conductor operations
2. **Message definitions** for all request and response types with proper field numbering
3. **Type mapping** from Go SDK models to protobuf messages
4. **Package organization** with proper Go package naming conventions
5. **Field optimization** using appropriate protobuf types and repeated fields

The protobuf definition serves as the contract between the Go server and .NET client, ensuring type safety and version compatibility.

#### **Step 2: Create Go gRPC Server**
The Go server implements the gRPC service and provides the bridge to the conductor-go SDK. This step involves:

1. **Service implementation** with all the RPC methods defined in the protobuf contract
2. **Type conversion** between protobuf messages and Go SDK models
3. **Error handling** with proper gRPC status codes and error responses
4. **Context management** for request cancellation and timeout handling
5. **Server setup** with proper gRPC server configuration and port binding

The server handles the complexity of protobuf serialization and provides a clean interface to the conductor-go SDK functionality.

#### **Step 3: Create .NET gRPC Client**
The .NET client uses the gRPC framework to communicate with the Go server. This step involves:

1. **Channel setup** with proper gRPC channel configuration and endpoint resolution
2. **Client generation** using protobuf-generated client classes
3. **Method dispatching** to route calls to the appropriate gRPC service methods
4. **Type conversion** between .NET objects and protobuf messages
5. **Error handling** with proper RPC exception management and status code handling

The client leverages the generated protobuf classes to provide type-safe communication with the gRPC server.

#### **Step 4: Create Adapter**
The adapter layer provides the interface between your test framework and the gRPC client. This step involves:

1. **Interface implementation** to match your framework's expected contract
